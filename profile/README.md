## Welcome to AVstack

### Where do I go from here?
If you'd like to prototype with the [Carla][carla] simulator, go to the [carla sandbox][carla-sandbox].

If you'd like to prototype with AV datasets (e.g., [Kitti][kitti], [nuScenes][nuscenes]) or your own platforms, check out [avstack-core][core] and [avstack-api][api].

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
